Grab realtime and delayed quotes from yahoo finance

A utility I created a while back for a finance stock price notification app.

As far as I know, the actual streaming API that I'm using is not intended for public consumption nor is it actually documented anywhere.

At the time I created this, I just looked at how Yahoo was updating its pages then listened for the same mechanism.

It's a little messy, but it worked for me.
